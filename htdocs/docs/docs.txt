Examples of requests:

For profile information of a user: 
https://phpsound.com/demo/api.php?t=u&q=USERNAME 

For a list of latest 20 tracks uploaded by a user: 
https://phpsound.com/demo/api.php?t=t&q=USERNAME 


An example of json decoding would be the following PHP code: 

<?php
header('Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8;'); 
$file = file_get_contents("https://phpsound.com/demo/api.php?t=t&q=USERNAME");
print_r(json_decode($file));
?>
